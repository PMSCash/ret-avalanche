Real Estate Token (RET) on Avalanche C‑Chain

Project Abstract

Real Estate Token (RET) is a blockchain‑native fractional ownership solution built on Avalanche C‑Chain that brings liquidity and accessibility to the traditionally illiquid real estate market. By minting each property as an ERC‑20 token, RET enables investors to buy, sell, and trade “shares” of real estate seamlessly—either peer‑to‑peer or via on‑chain DEX pools. This unlocks four key benefits:

Fractional Access: Lower entry barriers by letting users acquire precise slices of high‑value properties.

24/7 Liquidity: Token holders can transfer RET directly between wallets or seed a small AVAX/RET pool on Trader Joe (or any AVAX DEX) for instant price discovery.

Transparent Ownership: All holdings and transfers are immutably recorded on Avalanche, ensuring clear provenance and auditability.

Seamless Integration: Full MetaMask and wallet support, plus optional OTC APIs for institutional flows.

1. Project Description

Real Estate Token (RET) brings fractional ownership and liquidity to real estate by tokenizing properties on Avalanche C‑Chain. Each RET represents a share in a property pool, enabling 24/7 trading, transparent on‑chain records, and low entry barriers.

2. Goals & Use Cases

Democratize Access: Let retail and institutional investors buy/sell real estate slices.

Instant Liquidity: Enable peer‑to‑peer transfers or on‑chain swaps via AVAX/RET pools.

Collateral & Financing: Use RET as on‑chain collateral in DeFi protocols.

3. Benefits to Avalanche Ecosystem

TVL Growth: Drives assets into C‑Chain and AVAX liquidity.

DEX Volume: Increases trading on Trader Joe, Pangolin, etc.

Cross‑Chain Utility: Leverages Avalanche Bridge for multichain real‑estate portfolios.
